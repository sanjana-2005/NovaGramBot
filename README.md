# Tech Stack & Experience

This Telegram AI Chatbot is built using the following technologies: - 

  Python: Primary language for backend development. 
	Telegram Bot API: Used to interact with users and process commands/messages.
	MySQL: Database to store user data, chat history, and extracted text from images. 
	Google Gemini AI: Integrated to generate intelligent responses. 
	BeautifulSoup & Requests: Used for web scraping and fetching search results. 
	Pytesseract (OCR): Extracts text from images. 
	PIL (Pillow): Handles image processing. 
	httpx: Ensures asynchronous API requests.

# Internship Experience:

# Samsung R&D Institute 

  Developed a deep learning model to recommend photo filters based on image categories such as places, wildlife, food, people, and nature. 
  Designed a Vision Transformer (ViT) and ViT-MSN model from Hugging Face for feature extraction, enhancing the accuracy of filter recommendations across all image categories. 
  Integrated Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to augment the dataset by generating synthetic images with different filter styles, enhancing the modelâ€™s ability to generalize to unseen data.

# Combat Vehicles Research and Development Establishment (CVRDE), DRDO 

  Developed a deep learning model to predict vehicle tire ratings based on features like model, brand, size, type, price, etc. 
  Designed a neural network model for classifying tire ratings into categories using supervised learning. 
  Performed data cleaning, size extraction, label encoding, and feature scaling for effective model training. 
  Learned fundamentals of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), including algorithms, applications, and their impact on real-world challenges.
